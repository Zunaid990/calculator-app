## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This calculator uses:
- **HTML** for the layout and structure of the calculator interface
- **CSS** for styling, layout, responsiveness, and button animations
- **JavaScript** to handle all the calculation logic using `eval()` and manage user input

**Main Features:**
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Decimal support
- Clear (C) button
- Input displayed in real-time
- Responsive layout with modern styling

---

## Optimizations

- Structured code using modular functions
- Used `try/catch` for safe evaluation and error handling
- Styled buttons with hover and active states
- Applied `flexbox` and `grid` layout techniques for responsiveness
- Lightweight and fast performance without any libraries

## Lessons Learned:

Through this project, I improved my JavaScript DOM skills, practiced handling real-time user input, and learned how to safely use `eval()` with error handling. I also gained experience in building responsive layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

This project was a great way to reinforce core JavaScript concepts and build a clean, interactive UI.
